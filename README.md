## A Config Made By A Beginner For Neovim!

+ Started using neovim recently so made this repo for my config
+ Has beginner features for bridging the gap and learning neovim such as:
  + arrow key disable
  + mouse disable
  + Inverse Tab
  + And more!
+ Mainly for showing people my config rather than being a drop in because I still have much to learn!
